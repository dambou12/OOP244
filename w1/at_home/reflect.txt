1- In general, a namespace uniquely identifies a set of names so
 that there is no ambiguity when objects having different origins but
the same names are mixed together.For example we have 2 functions with the
same name and same code but a different return .to avoid the ambiguity ,we will
namespace to uniquely identifies every function.

2-The header file is important because its allows easier dividing program
code to many files then source code becomes more readable and understandable

3-we should not compile header files because its not containt a program just
a declaration of prototype and global variable

4-You should never include a cpp file ( or anything that is not a header ).
If you want to compile a file, pass it to the compiler.
If you both #include and compile a source file, you'll get multiple definition e

5-I learned difference between header file (header.h)and main file (main.cpp).i 
also learn how to compile program with multiple file
