1. How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a
 family or given name for the account? Why?

answer1:
There are 41 elements in the character arrays for family and given names. 
This is because max_name_length was 40 and an additional element for 
the null byte was included during the declaration of the arrays.


2. Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, 
this would generate an error.  Name the feature of C++ that allows this.

answer2:
The feature called function overloading in C++ allows this. The C++ 
compiler can differentiate between two member functions with the same 
identifier as long as they have different parameter types and order.


3. What have you learned during this workshop?

answer3:
I learned about the Luhn algorithm used in identificaion (e.g. SIN) 
verification and its implementation in C++ without the use of an array to 
store the ID. I was also able to practice the use of overloaded functions.
